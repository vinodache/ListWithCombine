A sample list with combine for playing around in iOS

Swift code that uses combine to display a list of items and then open up detail views.
This was created by using Open AI to understand the capability of AI when it comes to create iOS code.
And the result was, use Open AI as a junior developer when you can guide it as a senior developer or architect. 
One will also need to have good debugging and testing skills to correct errors made by Open AI.
Making Open Ai do complete coding without providing the right engineering guidance can lead to reduced productivity and poor quality.
However, under the guidance of a skilled Senior engineer good at Prompting, Open AI can improve productivity.

As next step, will need to experiment with CoPilot and see how the results compare.
